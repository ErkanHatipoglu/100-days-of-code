# Pong Game

## Overview
The Pong Game is a classic arcade game that has been recreated using Python and Turtle Graphics. It simulates a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. Players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The goal is to score points by getting the ball to pass the opponent's paddle.

- Run `main.py` to start the game.
- Players use the keyboard to move the paddles:
  - Left player uses the 'W' and 'S' keys for up and down movement.
  - Right player uses the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys.
- The game continues until a player scores a predetermined number of points.
- A game-over message is displayed when the game ends.

## Features
- Interactive paddle control with keyboard input.
- Collision detection and response between the ball, paddles, and game boundaries.
- Score tracking and display on the game screen.
- Game over condition and display message.

## Requirements

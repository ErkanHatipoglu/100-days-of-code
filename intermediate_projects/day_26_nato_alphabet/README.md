# NATO Alphabet

## Overview
The NATO Alphabet project is an interactive Python application designed to demonstrate the practical application of list and dictionary comprehensions. Users can input a word, and the program will translate each letter into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet code using data from a CSV file. This project serves as a valuable learning tool for Python enthusiasts keen on understanding data manipulation using Pandas and comprehension techniques.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Pandas installed. If not, install Pandas using `pip install pandas`.
3. Run the script. The program will prompt you to enter a word.
4. Upon entering a word, the program will output the list of NATO phonetic codes corresponding to each letter of the input word.

## Features
- Efficient data processing using list and dictionary comprehensions.
- CSV file reading and data manipulation using the Pandas library.
- Interactive user input to translate words to NATO phonetic codes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library

# Turtle Scripts

## Overview
Turtle Scripts is a collection of Python programs that utilize the Turtle graphics library to create a variety of interesting shapes, patterns, and designs. Inspired by natural phenomena, mathematical concepts, and famous artworks, these scripts provide a playful and educational exploration into the world of programming and visual art.

## Instructions

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required libraries listed in the Requirements section.
4. Navigate to the script you wish to run and execute it using Python.

## Features
- Shape Drawing: Scripts to draw simple geometric shapes like squares, circles, and more complex forms.
- Pattern Generation: Generate intricate patterns and designs, such as spirographs and dashed lines.
- Artistic Imitation: A special script inspired by Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, showcasing dot pattern creation.
- Random Walk Simulation: A script that simulates a random walk, creating a unique and colorful path each time it's run.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle Graphics Library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- Additional libraries for certain scripts, such as colorgram.py for color extraction (refer to individual script documentation for details).

# Pomodoro GUI App

## Overview
The Pomodoro GUI App is a simple time management tool that uses the Pomodoro technique, consisting of fixed work intervals separated by short breaks. It's designed with a straightforward interface that includes a timer countdown, and buttons to start or reset the timer, encouraging focused work sessions.

## Instructions
1. **Starting a Session**: Press the "Start" button to begin a 25-minute work session.
2. **Taking Breaks**: After each work session, a short break of 5 minutes is automatically started. Every fourth break is a long break of 20 minutes.
3. **Resetting the Timer**: The "Reset" button can be used at any time to stop the current session or break and reset the timer.

## Features
- A work session timer that counts down from 25 minutes.
- Automatic switching between work sessions and short/long breaks.
- Visual indicators for the current session type (work or break).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python).

# Intermediate Projects

Welcome to the `intermediate_projects` section of my "100 Days of Code" journey. In this folder, you'll find projects that build upon foundational concepts with increased complexity and deeper exploration of Python programming.

## Projects Overview

- **Day 15 - Coffee Machine**: Simulating a coffee machine using object-oriented programming.
- **Day 17 - Quiz Game**: Implementing a quiz game that uses data structures and file handling.
- **Day 18 - Turtle Scripts**: Creative coding using the Turtle graphics library.
- **Day 19 - Turtle Race**: A race simulation game using the Turtle module.
- **Day 20 and Day 21 - Snake Game**: Creating the classic Snake game, focusing on more advanced Python functionalities.

Each project folder includes the source code, a dedicated README, and any additional resources used or created during the development of the project.

## Learning Objectives

These projects are designed to challenge and enhance understanding in areas such as object-oriented programming, data handling, and utilizing libraries in Python. They provide a hands-on approach to intermediate concepts in Python programming.

## Ongoing Learning

This category is actively evolving with several more exciting projects coming soon as I continue my journey through the course.

Thank you for exploring my learning journey in Python programming!

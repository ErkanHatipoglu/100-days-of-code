# Intermediate Projects

Welcome to the `intermediate_projects` section of my "100 Days of Code" journey. In this folder, you'll find projects that build upon foundational concepts with increased complexity and deeper exploration of Python programming.

## Projects Overview

- **[Day 15 - Coffee Machine](day_15_coffee_machine)**: Simulating a coffee machine using object-oriented programming.
- **[Day 17 - Quiz Game](day_17_quiz_game)**: Implementing a quiz game that uses data structures and file handling.
- **[Day 18 - Turtle Scripts](day_18_turtle_scripts)**: Creative coding using the Turtle graphics library.
- **[Day 19 - Turtle Race](day_19_turtle_race)**: A race simulation game using the Turtle module.
- **[Day 20 and Day 21 - Snake Game](day_20_and_21_snake_game)**: Creating the classic Snake game, focusing on more advanced Python functionalities.
- **[Day 22 - Pong Game](day_22_pong_game)**: A classic Pong game implemented in Python using Turtle Graphics. This project covers basic game development concepts like collision detection, user input handling, and graphical rendering.
- **[Day 23 - Turtle Crossing Game](day_23_turtle_crossing_game)**: A game where the player controls a turtle navigating through a busy road with moving cars. It showcases collision detection, event handling, and object-oriented programming in Python. This game gets progressively more challenging, requiring strategic movement and timing.
- **[Day 25 - US States Game](day_25_us_states_game)**: Test your knowledge of US geography in this interactive game that challenges you to name all 50 states. Leveraging Turtle graphics and CSV data, the game visualizes your progress on a map, offering a fun and educational way to learn state names and locations. Missed states are recorded, providing a targeted learning opportunity for future review.
- **[Day 26 - NATO Alphabet](day_26_nato_alphabet)**: "Translating words into NATO phonetic codes interactively, showcasing the use of Pandas for CSV data handling and comprehension techniques in Python."

Each project folder includes the source code, a dedicated README, and any additional resources used or created during the development of the project.

## Learning Objectives

These projects are designed to challenge and enhance understanding in areas such as object-oriented programming, data handling, and utilizing libraries in Python. They provide a hands-on approach to intermediate concepts in Python programming.

## Ongoing Learning

This category is actively evolving with several more exciting projects coming soon as I continue my journey through the course.

Thank you for exploring my learning journey in Python programming!

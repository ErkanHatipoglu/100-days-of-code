# Beginner Projects

Welcome to the `beginner_projects` section of my "100 Days of Code" journey. This folder contains a series of Python projects that represent the initial phase of the course, focusing on fundamental concepts and simpler applications.

## Projects Overview

- **Day 08 - Caesar Cipher**: An introduction to basic encryption techniques.
- **Day 09 - Secret Auction**: Implementation of a simple auction system.
- **Day 10 - Calculator App**: Building a basic calculator application.
- **Day 11 - Blackjack Game**: Creating a command-line Blackjack game.
- **Day 12 - Number Guessing Game**: A fun game to guess a number within a range.
- **Day 14 - Higher Lower Game**: A fun and engaging project where players guess which celebrity has more followers on Instagram.

Each project folder includes the source code, a dedicated README, and any additional resources used or created during the development of the project.

## Learning Objectives

These projects focus on solidifying basic programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions in Python. They also introduce problem-solving and simple algorithmic thinking.

Thank you for exploring my learning journey in Python programming!

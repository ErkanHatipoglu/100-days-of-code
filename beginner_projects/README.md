# Beginner Projects

Welcome to the `beginner_projects` section of my "100 Days of Code" journey. This folder contains a series of Python projects that represent the initial phase of the course, focusing on fundamental concepts and simpler applications.

## Projects Overview

- **[Day 08 - Caesar Cipher](day_8_caesar_cipher)**: An introduction to basic encryption techniques.
- **[Day 09 - Secret Auction](day_9_secret_auction)**: Implementation of a simple auction system.
- **[Day 10 - Calculator App](day_10_calculator_app)**: Building a basic calculator application.
- **[Day 11 - Blackjack Game](day_11_blackjack_game)**: Creating a command-line Blackjack game.
- **[Day 12 - Number Guessing Game](day_12_number_guessing_game)**: A fun game to guess a number within a range.
- **[Day 14 - Higher Lower Game](day_14_higher_lower_game)**: A fun and engaging project where players guess which celebrity has more followers on Instagram.

Each project folder includes the source code, a dedicated README, and any additional resources used or created during the development of the project.

## Learning Objectives

These projects focus on solidifying basic programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions in Python. They also introduce problem-solving and simple algorithmic thinking.

Thank you for exploring my learning journey in Python programming!

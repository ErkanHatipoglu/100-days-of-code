# 100 Days of Code

This repository contains some of the Python projects I have done for the Udemy Course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) given by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/#instructor-1).

Each project has its own directory and a README file. You can either browse the code or follow the links below to read and learn about the projects.

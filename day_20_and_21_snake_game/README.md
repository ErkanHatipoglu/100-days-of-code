# Snake Game

## Overview
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented in Python. In this game, the player controls a snake, guiding it to eat food while avoiding walls and its own growing tail. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game increasingly challenging. This project is a great example of using Python's Turtle graphics library to create a simple yet entertaining game.

## Instructions
To play the game:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the main Python file (main.py).
4. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
5. Try to eat as much food as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own tail.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay.
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
- Score tracking displayed on the screen.
- Game over handling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
